# Vehicle Model Recogniser

The **Vehicle Model Recognizer** project is an innovative application of artificial intelligence technology. Its primary objective is to recognize different models of vehicles from images and CCTV footage with great accuracy.

The project consists of two models: an *image classification* model and a *detection model*. The image classification model uses deep learning algorithms to analyze images and identify the make and model of the vehicle in the image. On the other hand, the detection model utilizes object detection techniques to identify and locate vehicles in real-time video streams captured by CCTV cameras.

The Vehicle Model Recognizer has many potential applications, including security surveillance, traffic monitoring, and automotive industry research. The following are some possible usage scenarios:

* **Security surveillance:** *The project could be used to identify suspicious vehicles in real-time video footage from CCTV cameras, making it easier for security personnel to respond to potential security threats.*

* **Traffic monitoring:** *The Vehicle Model Recognizer could be used to analyze traffic patterns and congestion, helping traffic management authorities optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion.*

* **Automotive industry research:** *The project could be used by automotive manufacturers to analyze vehicle usage patterns and trends, as well as track the performance of their vehicles in different locations and environments.*

* **Law enforcement:** *The Vehicle Model Recognizer could be used by law enforcement agencies to identify vehicles involved in crimes, including hit-and-run accidents, car thefts, and kidnappings.*

Overall, the Vehicle Model Recognizer project has many potential applications and can be a valuable tool for a wide range of industries and organizations.
